# Omnibar
The Omnibar is St. Jude Cloud's primary navigation. It is used on every app or site, always at the top of each view.

### Sketch File
To use the omnibar in your sketch files, you can go to the [design.stjude.cloud sketch.cloud](https://www.sketch.com/team/NAv4/p/KYEe) directory and choose which screen size template you would like to start your prototype or design.
